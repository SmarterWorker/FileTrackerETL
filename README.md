## Client Challenge

A client struggled with managing a large volume of files in various formats (CSV, TXT, XML, JSON, etc.). Their small IT team was stretched thin, and departments used different methods for file exchange. Challenges included:

- **Difficulty tracking and processing files**
- **Lack of transparency in file status**
- **Delays in updates and limited access to logs**
- **Difficulty identifying and resolving issues**

These inefficiencies hindered productivity and made file management cumbersome.

## Solution

I developed a robust, automated file processing and tracking system using Python Flask, Node.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, and PowerShell. The solution:

- **Automates file ingestion, processing, and tracking by file type**
- **Provides real-time updates through a user-friendly web interface**
- **Ensures secure file transmission and storage with SFTP and industry-standard encryption**
- **Centralises file operations (copy, move, SFTP) for all departments**
- **Integrates a REST API for seamless connectivity with external applications**
- **Allows easy extension for new file types via simple database configuration**

## Results

- **Streamlined Processing:** Automated workflows reduced manual effort, saving time and resources.
- **Enhanced Security:** Sensitive data protected with PostgreSQL, SFTP, and encryption, ensuring compliance.
- **Improved Transparency:** Real-time updates and a clear web interface empowered users to track files independently.
- **Scalability and Integration:** The REST API enabled future growth and integration with other systems.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Adding support for new file types is as simple as updating the database configuration.

**This solution demonstrates how automation, security, and user-centric design can transform complex file management challenges into efficient, transparent, and scalable processes.**
**Note: Processing of files are excluded from this repo since they have sensitive information.**
